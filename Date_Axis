/*
This Table-Valued Function (TVF) will return a table of dates, along with week, month and quarter start and end dates for the date in question.
When working with time-series data, you may find a date which has no data and therefore will not exist in your results. 

In some situations its important to see those dates. For example, if you were to create an anomoly report which 
shows how many events are imported into your table by day, then a day with no data may be silently hidden.
